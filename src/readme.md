@chill- Whatever you do, act always in full presence of mind: be mindful in eating and drinking, in walking or standing, in sleeping or waking, while talking or while being silent. - Buddha

syrup village work:
1. easy and plotting -> users page [user info is shown, next task to fill tabs part]
2. secondary hero fight -> add react native gifted chat [added gifted chat, next task to add one to one chat]
3. main villain fight -> add badlee [added form to add badlee, image picker not working]
4. read & understand badlee documentation -> how redux works [lot of folder structure uped, lets see in future.. documentation left]

reward :
usopp -> add badlee section, we have a strategist. [yea, is so cool]
going merry -> codebase will get upgrade. [hahaha, meeerrrry! i am so glad. I swear to take take of you.]


With this, I finish up syrup village. Main village was hard, however we are able to add badlees now [though image is not working]
